## How to Translate

__NOTE:__ the full list of locales is available at the URL specified inside the source "en.lang" file.

Translate all strings which appear to the __right__ to the equal sign (=)

Example:
text_next=Next __becomes__ text_next=Next_in_your_language

__NOTES:__

* in the string there might be styling and new line characters.
* a new line character is represented by a backslash (\)
* styling characters are similar to HTML/XML tags. they begin with a <tag> and end with a </tag> (where tag is the actual styling attribute)
* you don't need to translate the styling characters!
* you don't need to touch the new line characters!
